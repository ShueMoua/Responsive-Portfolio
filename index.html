                <p>Hello, my name is Shuelong Moua. My nickname is Shue. I was born in California, and moved to
                    Minnesota when I was 2 years old. I lived in Saint Paul for a couple years, and moved to
                    Minneapolis. I have lived in Minneapolis for over 20 years now. I joined the Army Nataional Guard
                    when I was 19 years old and served for 6 years. My job in the National Guard was a combat engineer.
                    What I did as a combat engineer was, I was pretty much an infantryman, and I also worked with
                    explosives. I learned how to detect landmines, and prime explosvies. I worked as a combat engineer
                    for 3 years, and then I decided to get a job in a field where it will help further my career in my
                    civillian life. At the time, I loved cooking and had a lot of experience in the food industry. So, I
                    decided to switch my job to become a cook. It was totally different from what I expected. The meals
                    were all cooked in large portions and you had to follow the army recipes, and that made the food
                    turn out really bland most the time. I served as a cook for another 3 years, and left the army as a
                    Sergeant. After that, I injured my knee badly in a snowboarding accident. I tore 3 ligaments and
                    that took me out of the restaurant industry. Then I started looking for something else I could do as
                    a career. I started working in an office, and found out that I have really strong analytical and
                    technical skills. That's when I decided to go into IT. I did a program for a basic A+ certification
                    and enjoyed it. I was trying to figure out which path I wanted to take in the IT industry. I finally
                    decided on coding, because it intrigued me and I thought it was really cool. Also a friend of mine,
                    works with artifical intelligence and told me about how he was able to build programs from writing
                    code. That's how I ended up here at this bootcamp.</p>
